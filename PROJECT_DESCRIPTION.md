# Rydlo - Bike Rental Management System

Rydlo is a full-stack bike rental platform built with Spring Boot and React, enabling seamless bike rentals for customers, owners, and administrators. The system features JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and a comprehensive booking engine with real-time availability checking and dynamic pricing calculations including taxes and extra kilometer charges.

Key features include a 24-hour cancellation policy, transaction management with payment simulation (Razorpay integration ready), and detailed analytics dashboards. The backend leverages Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate, and RESTful APIs, while the frontend uses React Router and Axios for a responsive, mobile-first user experience.

The platform is architected with scalability in mind, with plans to migrate to a microservices architecture for improved modularity, independent scaling, and enhanced fault isolation. Future enhancements include real payment gateway integration, automated refunds, rating systems, and mobile applications.
